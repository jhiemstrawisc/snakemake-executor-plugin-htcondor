        Check the status of active jobs by reading their HTCondor log files.

        This implementation uses a two-pass approach to avoid blocking:

        Pass 1 (fast, non-blocking):
          - Read job event logs for all jobs (local file I/O, microseconds each)
          - Process jobs with known states immediately
          - Collect jobs needing fallback into a batch

        Pass 2 (batched, single blocking call if needed):
          - Query schedd once for all jobs needing fallback
          - Query history once for jobs not found in schedd
          - Process remaining jobs

        This approach ensures that slow history queries for one job don't block
        status checks for other jobs. The common case (log files available) is
        very fast, and the fallback case batches queries efficiently.

        The method reads all new events from each job's log file and determines
        the current state. Terminal states (completed, removed) are cached
        to avoid re-reading finished jobs. Held jobs are monitored with a timeout.
